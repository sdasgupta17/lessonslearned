The most interesting topic during the Digital Literacy for Decision Makers class to me was how to best retain developers for my own business. On top of hiring and attracting developers, I found it is important to motivate them to stay so I can minimize the hidden costs of turnover. Some people even say retaining employees is now more important than retaining customers.

We have discussed how to retain developers during the class as follows :
-	Provide personal growth through project
-	Provide flexibility at work, such as required vacation  
-	Give them sense of ownership
